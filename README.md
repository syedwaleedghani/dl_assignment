Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to create a stronger, more robust model than any individual model in the ensemble. Boosting is one specific approach within ensemble learning. Boosting algorithms focus on training weak learners sequentially, with each new learner correcting the errors of the previous ones. The most popular boosting algorithms include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. 

AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):

Weak Learner Selection: Start with a simple weak learner (e.g., a shallow decision tree).

Initial Weights: Assign equal weights to all training examples.

Training: Train the weak learner on the data. Increase the weights of misclassified examples.

Combine Models: Combine the weak learners with a weighted sum, giving more weight to those with lower training error.

Repeat: Repeat the process with updated weights until a predefined number of weak learners are trained or perfect predictions are achieved.
